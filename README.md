# DelaunayTriangulation
This project is designed to implement the incremental Delaunay Triangulation Algorithm. 

This algorithm is used to maximize the minimum angle of all the angles of the triangles in the triangulation.

The data structures we use in this project is called "Half Edge" data structure, which is developed by Professor Xianfeng Gu
in Computer Science Department at Stony Brook University.

The main implementation is shown in GaussCurvature_Sample -> GaussCurvature -> main.cpp
